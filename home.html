<h3 id= This-is-different->Why we dream and other theories!</h3>

<p> There are many,many,many,theories as to why we dream.
A major theory was created by Sigmund Feud that was
widely popular in the 19th century.  He believed that
dreams gave us access to our unconscious inner conflicts.
He called them “ the royal road to the knowledge on the
part that the unconscious plays in mental life.
Another theory that came about a few years later was
created by Alfred Adler. Alfred Adler believed that
“dreams reflect the current lifestyle, and offer
solutions to current contemporary conflicts”.
Research on dreams started to become popular  around
the same time that research on the REM ( rapid eye movement)
started to become well known as well.
