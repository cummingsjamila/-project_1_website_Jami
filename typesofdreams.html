<p>Nightmares are common in young-children and adults. Often nightmares are caused by:
Stress, conflict, fear, trauma, emotional problems, medication/drug use, and illness.
If you feel as though have a recurring nightmare(s), your subconscious may be trying to tell
you something.Alway listen to it, for it’s telling you for a reason. If you can't figure out
what’s the cause behind your bad dreams, and you continue to have them, talk to a doctor.
Having frequent nightmares can be bad for your health causing you to become restless,anxious, and
paranoid.Talking to doctors may help you figure out what is causing your nightmares. Always
keep in mind that no matter how scary a nightmare is, it is not real.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a dream where you knew you were dreaming while in a dream state?
This is called a lucid dreaming. Research has shown that lucid dreaming is accompanied by
an increased activation of parts of the brain that are normally not active during your REM sleep.
Lucid dreaming represents a brain state between REM sleep and being awake.Some people who
are lucid dreamers are able to influence the direction of their dream. Therefore they are able
to change what is going on in their dream. Think of it like being in a video game except there
isn’t a pre-made storyline; just you controlling what will and when things will happen. While this may
 be a good tactic to take on during a nightmare, it’s better for you let your dreams occur naturally
 Dream experts do not suport lucid dreaming because there isn’t a lot of research on the issue,
therefore the cons are not well-known. </P>

<h3> Dream Incubation </h3>

<p>This is basically the process of putting the phrase “Just sleep on it” to the test.
The concept behind this is to just think of an issue/topic that it bothering you. Then
go to sleep and when you wake up you should have a solution. It isn’t the best forming of
dreaming seeming how you have to a have a bit of control of your dreams but not to much.
If you have too much control then it changes the answer from being fate to you creating “fate”.</p>
