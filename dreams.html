<p>The definition of dreams is: Dreams are a series of thoughts,
images, and sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep.
They can make you feel happy, sad, scared, or somewhere in between!
They can be realistic or they can be convoluted nightmares.
  Dreams can happen anytime you are asleep. Some experts believe
that we dream up to 4-6 times a night.</p>

<p> Scientists have yet to figure out why we dream. Of course
there are tons of different types of theories, but theories are
 only theories. Some people believe that dreams have no purpose
 or meaning and are just activites to keep the brain activities.
  Others believe that dreaming is necessary for good mental,
   emotional, and even physical health. Studies do show that
  dreaming does affect overall health. In a study conducted,
   those who were not able to dream/ they could not recall their
dreams experienced the following: Increased tension,
anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, lack of
 coordination, weight gain, and having a tendency to
 hallucinate.</P>

<h3> What do dreams mean?</h3>
<p> Well no one really knows for sure!
 Many believe that dreams help us deal with
  everyday emotions and feelings.
  Experts believe that when we dream we
are expressing our innermost thoughts and our darkest serects. </p>
