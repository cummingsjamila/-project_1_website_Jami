<h2> What do our dreams means? </h2>
  <p> Dreaming itself is a very convoluted concept. The way most people underestand
    it is that we go to sleep perhaps with a certain thing/emotion
    on our mind and then we have vivid images which are otherwise
    known as dreaming. Now if you are anything like me and
  are curious about everything, then I'm sure you have
  wondered about what they mean!
  <h3> Important dream symbols to look for </h3>
  <p> The first step to being able to interpret dreams
    is to know what the most important symbols are.
    Since there are so many in the list I have only decided to list the top five.

      <li>
         <h4>Being Chased </h4>
        <p> Being chased is one of the most commonly reported dreams.
        Because it is such a vivid emotion we tend to be able to remember
        the whole dream itself. Many experts believe that chase dreams mean
        we may not be addressing
      something in our lives that requries attention.

          <h4> Water Dreams</h4>
          <p>It's said that water typically reprsents our inner
          emoitions or our unconscious minds. The condition of the water
        vivid bright ocean water or cloudy, dark, rain water
      often helps to represent emotions and mental health.   </p>

      <p> Wether it's a car, an airplane, train, ship,
      anything you can travel in, know that in dreams
      the vehcile you travel in can relfect the road in
      which we are taking, and how much we
      have control over our current
      situtations. This can help show us the obstacles
     we have already faced or the ones
      we have yet to overcome.

      <p> When you see people in your dreams
      it can reflect the different aspects of
      the self. The people in dreams can also
      relate to the goals we want to achive, as well
     as the traits we desire most.

      <h4> Falling/Flying </h4>
        <img src=

        <p>  Flying in a dream depending on how
      well it's done, relates to how much control
    we have over our lives. If you are flying
    well, and soaring high you are a very confident person and achieve many
    of your goals. If you are falling in a dream
    it's not always a bad thing! Some experts believe
    that it means that when you are falling in slow motion
    you a releasing toxic energy and better times are ahead. However
    if you feel as though you're falling from a high hieght
    perhaps you are losing control over things in your life.   </p>
