<h2> What are dreams and why do we have them? </h2>
<h3> The History of Dreams </h3>
<p>	In ancient society dreams were very important.
  Dreams influenced our ancestors, their decisions they make
   in their everyday lives. How do we know this you may wonder?
  Ancient texts such as the bible are filled with tons of
  references to people having vivid visions that provide them
  with the answers to their daily problems!

<h3>Why we dream and other theories!</h3>
<p> There are many many many theories as to why we dream.
A major theory was created by Sigmund Feud that was
widely popular in the 19th century.  He believed that
dreams gave us access to our unconscious inner conflicts.
He called them “ the royal road to the knowledge on the
part that the unconscious plays in mental life.
Another theory that came about a few years later was
created by Alfred Adler. Alfred Adler believed that
“dreams reflect the current lifestyle, and offer
solutions to current contemporary conflicts”.
Research on dreams started to become popular  around
the same time that research on the REM ( rapid eye movement)
started to become well known as well.
